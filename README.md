# Octopost
*A Multithreaded used car posting crawler*

Octopost is a web crawler designed to
  * Retrieve all used car ads on every Craigslist site
  * Parse the ad to find features such as make, model, price, mileage, and many more
  * Save useful features in a centralized database
  
 Octopost is most useful when used with its companion webapp https://github.com/julien-piet/car_analytics
 
## Design

Octopost makes use of the Threading API in python to make use of down time during a request.
It has a parallel queue architecture to pipeline the loading process. Furthermore, Octopost uses the NHTSA API at https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/ to get detailed information on specific models to complete the data pulled from craigslist
